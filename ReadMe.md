# Day Planner App

## User Story

Our users are highly effective people that want to maximize their time on a hourly basis. This Day Planner allows them to store tasks each day and see visual how their day is progressing. 

## Description

This app generates a list of hour boxes using HTML and JQuery that can be used in order to save to-do items.

## Development

* I used jquery to as the basis of this app. 
* I then used a for-loop to generate the hour boxes
* The pastPresent() function allows the colors to render different based on the time of day in relation to the calender

## Issues

* I was not able to store to-dos to the local storage, but I can do it if given enough time.
* The local storage syntax doesn't seem impossible so I know I can fix it. 

## Future Development

Hourly boxes would be better if there was a collapsable option that allowed people to write down more tasks. Tasks could be installed that allow users to customize specific tasks instad of simply writing text. A task timer could be installed that notifies a user when a task is almost expired.
