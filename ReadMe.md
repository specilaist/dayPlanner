# Day Planner App

## User Story

* This app generates a list of hour boxes that can be used in order to save to-do items.

## Development

* I used jquery to as the basis of this app. 
* I then used a for-loop to generate the hour boxes
* The pastPresent() function allows the colors to render different based on the time of day in relation to the calender

## Issues

* I was not able to store to-dos to the local storage, but I can do it if given enough time.
* The local storage syntax doesn't seem impossible so I know I can fix it.
